# Wikipedia Search

### A Modern Angular Bootcamp project

[View the demo](https://wikipedia-search-jet.vercel.app/)

This Wikipedia-search project was done as part of [The Modern Angular Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-modern-angular-bootcamp) course. I finished working on this project in February 2024.

Wikipedia searching tool which is used to do a search of the Wikipedia base of articles. A user enters a search term and then a list of 10 articles that match the search term gets printed below. 

For every article, the title, the word count and a short snippet of the article gets printed. The title is also clickable so that a user should be able to navigate to an article on Wikipedia.

**Some of the concepts that form part of this project:**
- Fetching data from an outside API
- Communication between components
- Angular app security
